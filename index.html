			<h4>Welcome</h4>
			<p> Welcome to my online version of the Life Skills class none of us ever took! The mission of this site is to equip the average person with basic skills that are necessary to navigate through life successfully. I wanted to have an online forum because I think it's important for everyone to have access to this type of information. Some of us did not have these guidelines given by parents or family, some of us are trying to figure it all out, some of us didn't have parents, some of us had parents that never learned these lessons for themselves… Whatever the case may be, your reason brought you here. And please, by no means do I want you to consider me an expert. I am not a guru with any secrets to life or enlightenment. I simple fell on hard times and became introspective: I took a good hard objective look at myself, my life, the people around me, and the decisions I had made thus far. I had to recognize what mistakes, excuses, bad habits I made and where I could have avoided a situation with a small piece of advice. And here we are: simple tips and tricks to avoid unnecessary hardships and improve the livelihood of anyone who happens upon it. I hope you enjoy the site and take something from it. Feel free to make requests for subject matter, give suggestions and feedback.</p> 
			<p> I have a hope to change the curriculum of public schools to include a Life Skills class, because I think it, by definition, is a part of the promise of what our education is supposed to deliver. We send kids to school because it is supposed to teach them how to think, to learn about the world around them, and prepare them to enter into the world at large as an independent adult. Is it the sole responsibility of the school to groom a child into an adult? No. But, I do think that we should be teaching them how to apply to college, how to fill out a job application, basics in financial literacy, sex education, options for after high school (not just that they immediately have to go to a four-year university), basic law, and health basics. These, as the heading of this website state, are all things that a lot of us never get taught outright but are somehow expected to know. When not everyone has exposure to these life lessons at home, and yet everyone is supposed to know them… Where else should it be taught on a large platform than in public schools? Many private schools have some of these subjects as a part of their curriculum; I only want to even the playing field.</p>
			<h4 id="me">About Me</h4>
			<p>My name is Symone, though I usually prefer to go by Moh. I am 21 years old. I love in Chicago, Illinois, and I am currently enrolled in an IT and business skill development program called Year Up. Though currently on break from school, my major is English in Secondary Education with a minor in Black Studies. My eventual goal in life is to teach and open learning, resource, and arts centers on Chicago's South and West sides. I want to help evolve the curriculum in public schools to the changing time we are in. I think it's foolish to try to snatch electronics away from kids in school. Instead, I want to develop educational technology to be used as a viable tool in the classroom. In my personal life, I enjoy listening to music, reading, watching movies and anime, writing poetry, food, and intelligent conversation. I am (as you might find later on the site) quite passionate but can be shy in real life. If you ask me it's because of the many conflicting aspects of my personality, which I use my zodiac signs to describe: Leo and Virgo.</br>
