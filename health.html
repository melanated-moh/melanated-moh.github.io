	<h4>Healthier Living Tips</h4>
<p><ul><li>Living a healthy lifestyle is not always easy, and for a lot of us it can feel impossible. 	Healthy and organic food can get expensive and not everybody can afford it. I'm not asking anybody to drop $250 in whole foods twice a month. I just wanted to share a couple of tips and changes in my diet that have improved on my health. Most of these are simple and easy to do, and it might seem as though it doesn't make much of a difference, but they definitely add up. 
	<li>Switch from white to brown: stop consuming anything that is unnecessarily bleached. This includes eggs, flour, sugar, bread, and rice.
	Though they can get expensive try to eat organic and non-processed meats. Processed meats have been proven to be cancerous and extremely unhealthy. It's not always possible to buy organic but if you have to choose between where to go for a better quality and where to go for a bargain, do not skimp on the meats.</li>
	<li>HYDRATE! Your body needs way more water than we realize. We're supposed to drink about 8 cups a day. If you can't live a day without pop, juice, or coffee then ease your way into it. To help the transition, think about all the money you will save when the only thing you have to spend on your drinks is enough to get a filter. Alternatives that are chock full of nutrients and antioxidants are tea and raw juices. Green tea is full of caffeine and the caffeine naturally found in it releases slowly in the body and therefore does not make you crash so it is a great alternative for coffee. Trust me, there was a point in time when you couldn't get a pleasant attitude out of me if I hadn't had my cup of the day. And raw juices are delicious but can be really expensive. For me, they are rare indulgences. But, keep in mind that water is the most important thing that your body needs.</li>  
	<li>I know it's no fun to think about, but no fast food! It's so terrible for you. And no, a lunch here and there will definitely not kill you or even give you cancer. But, consistently having fast food and munchies from the corner store be a meal and part of your diet is not okay. Eventually it's going to give you diabetes, high-blood pressure, possibly obesity, cancer, or clogged arteries. Besides, eating at home saves money in the long run.  Yes, on Tuesday a $7 meal is cheaper than going shopping for groceries. But comparatively, the cost of a sandwich and soup every day is less when you make it at home than if you buy it elsewhere.</li>
	<li>Try to add different superfoods to your diet, they are bursting with antioxidants, nutrients, and detoxing capabilities. These include: avocado, pomegranate, quinoa, kale, spinach, oatmeal, almonds, curry, apples, eggs, garlic, ginger, lentils, and beans (to name a few). 
	We're all busy. It's not really fun to work out but your body needs exercise. It doesn't have to be hours every day but try to work in a half hour a couple times in a week. It will make a huge difference, and probably start to increase your metabolism and improve your sleep pattern. If you're anything like me, straight up running isn't even a punishment you would wish on your worst enemy, let alone yourself. But, there are alternatives out there, the most important thing is that you get your body moving and sweating. If you don't want to run/jog or lift weights try walking, swimming, biking, skating, machines, floor exercises, and bouts of a sport you find fun like basketball or soccer.</li>
