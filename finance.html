	<h4 id="finance">Financial Literacy</h4>
	<p>Financial literacy is the ability to make sound, informed decisions regarding money management. I found it to be an important topic for this site because most public schools in the US do not require finance classes, and therefore navigate through life nearly illiterate and perpetuating the predatory nature of capitalism. Even worse, many adults never learn financial literacy; they only learn to pay bills but never develop an intelligence for how to handle money and create wealth. Therefore financial literacy has a much wider application and need outside of the classroom, it affects your personal life, mobility in and quality of life, and your exchange with the economies around you.  Negligence in understanding finances cause:
<ul><li>Higher rates and amounts of debt</li>
	<li>Bad spending habits</li> 
	<li>Inability to/ignorance of/lack of motivation and will to save money</li>
	<li>Zero concept of wealth vs. material</li>
	<li>No understanding of or action to invest</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tax">Taxes</h4>
<p>When you  have an income you don't get the entirety of the wages you've earned, a percentage of your wages go to the state and federal government, social security and Medicare.
</br>
Filing taxes depends on level of income, not age or occupation etc.
	<ul><li>Dependents w a source of income under 19yo or 24 if a full time student can file with their guardian and have their return added to their return</li></ul>

<ul><li>Keep ALL pay stubs for your record</li>
<li>Weigh all your options and choose the best plan for filing for you/your type of income</li> 
	<ul><li>If you own a business it's best to get them professionally done</li>
	<li>If you own property do your research first: owning your own home can constitute simply enough filing to do it own your own, but you will probably need an upgraded version of software so you will have to pay for it though it will be much less than going to a professional. If you own property that you rent out to others, it would probably be best to go to a professional.</li>
	<li>If you work part time or full time, clock in and out every day (providing you don't have extenuating circumstances) then you should file on your own. There are many softwares available, it's easy, and free.</li></ul>
</ul>
<ul><li>Keep receipts, write down every time you spend money and make an estimate for how much you spend on average in a week/month</li>
<li>create a budget (you can use the template below)</li>
<li>immediately put away money for bills and necessities THEN allow for spending
automatic pay for bills</li>
<li>thrifting</li>
<li>pay for things in increments</li>
<li>get off brand when applicable, only get brand names when you have to
cook at home as much as possible</li> 
<li>DIY!</li> 
<li>buy dry goods and household items from somewhere cheap (like family dollar or jewel etc.) and buy produce and meats from aldi's or (treasure island, whole foods, mariano's depending on your financial abilities)
redplum and coupons</li>
